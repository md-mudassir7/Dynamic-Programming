Intuition:-

    1.The structure of the question is quite clear that it promotes the use of recursion . The recursion approach of this question can be like: 
    we start iteration from beginning and step by step we increase the size of substr that we are checking for palindromes . Once the palindrome substr is found ,the substr needs to go to a vector/list storing those palindromes substr . This is how the brute recursion will work .
    
    3.The optimization of the above recursion is backtracking.
    
    4.A backtracking algorithm uses the depth-first search method. When it starts exploring the solutions, a bounding or a helper function is applied so that the algorithm can check if the so-far built solution satisfies the constraints. If it does, it continues searching. If it doesnâ€™t, the branch would be eliminated, and the algorithm goes back to the level before. In simple words backtracking starts from some intermediate position where there is still a hope to get a new palindrome .
    
    5.In backtracking algo there is always a helper metod or a safe checker merhod which checks whether the built soution satisifes the conditions or not . This one thing has certainity of 100%.


Algorithm :-

    1.In backtracking, one thing is sure i.e a helper method. In our problem we will need a bool helper method which will check the palindrome conditions, let's name it as bool isPalindrome() .
    
    2.Now let's create some variables : result vector for storing all the substring which satisfies the palindrome condition , path vector for storing the ongoing substr which has the potential of satisfying the conditions of palindrome , start variable for storing the start position of the current substr , index i for traversing inside the substring and n fro storing the size of given string s.
    
    3.Now we search from start till the end of the string. Once we reach a position i such that the sub-string from start to i (s.substr(start, i - start + 1)) is a palindrome, we add it to our path variable. Then we recursively call the same method to execute the remaining substring . 
    
    4.Once we reach the end of the string, we add palindromes path into the result of all the possible partitioning .
    Remember that at position i , we find s.substr(start, i - start + 1) to be a palindrome and we immediately add it to path . Now think that there may be a position j such that j > i and s.substr(start, j - start + 1) is also a palindrome. 
    
    5.Thus now we need to go back to our start before adding s.substr(start, i - start + 1) to path and continue to find the next palindrome position after i . And after this evertime we simply need to remove or pop s.substr(start, i - start + 1) out of path to execute the backtracking algo .
    
    6.The steps we executed in the above step is none other than the famous dfs .
