Approach(class Solution1)

    1.At any index in the array we can either buy or not buy or if we have bought any stock previously we can sell or not sell

    2.To keep track of wheather we have bought any stock or not we can use a variable canBuy which tells us if we can buy the current stock or sell it

    3.If we can buy then we have 2 options we can buy the current stock or not buy it.If we decide to buy then we decrease the profit with the value of current stock and update canBuy to 0 since we cannot buy anything until we sell that stock,else if we decide not to buy we can move on with our canBuy as 1 since we have to buy anything at some point

    4.If we cannot buy then we can decide to either sell or not sell,if we decide to sell then we update canBuy to 1 since we can buy the stock now and decrease noOfTransactionRemaining by 1 since one transaction is complete and we move to the next index,if we decide not to sell then canBuy and noOfTransactionRemaining will still be the same i.e we can look for some other day to sell the stock

    5.If we have decided to sell the stock then we pay the transaction fee and get the maximum profit out of all transactions generated by the recursion

    6.When we start the recursion with the first index we can obvoiusly ony buy that stock since we dont have any elements before it

    7.The only change here is that when we can sell and we decide to sell then we move 2 steps ahead inorder to skip the cooldown day 

    8.The comments in the code give a proper explaination

Approach(class Solution2)

    1.It is a bottom up dynamic programing based solution of the above recusrion code

    2.The code gives proper explaination

Approach(class Solution3)

    1.It is a space optimised programing solution

    2.In the dp code we see that dp[i+1] is being used so instead of that we can create 2 arrays of size 2 each,current and next

    3.we replace dp[i+1] by next hence we can optimise a lot of space used by the above dp code
