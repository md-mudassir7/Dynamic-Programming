Approach(recusrion)

    1.At any day in the array days we have 3 choices, we can buy a 1-day pass,7-day pass,or a 30-day pass

    2.We explore all the three choices and find out the minimum cost required to travel on all the days by calculating the minimum of all 3 choices

    3.At any point dp[i] denotes the answer for first i elements of the array

Approach(Dynamic Programming)

    1.This is the dynamic programming code of the above recursion approach
